# PANDORA

## The Project

Painlessly Attempting a Numerical Democratization Of Residual Analysis (PANDORA)

## Unique Features
1. Perform astrophysical inference and model selection (product space sampling) on Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data sets using normalizing flows.
2. [Multi-pulsar Gibbs sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11944) algorithm for the most general, agnostic, per-frequency Bayesian search for a low-frequency (red) noise process in a PTA data.

## Useful Features
Perform various real data set GWB detection analyses the fastest way possible given the limitations of JAX, Numpy, and your own hardware!
