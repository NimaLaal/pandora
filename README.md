# PANDORA

## The Project

Painlessly Attempting a Numerical Democratization Of Residual Analysis (PANDORA)

## Unique Features
Perform astrophysical inference and model selection (product space sampling) on Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data sets using normalizing flows.
Multi-pulsar Gibbs sampling algorithm for the most general, agnostic, per-frequency Bayesian search for a low-frequency (red) noise process in PTA data <a id='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11944'></a>

## Useful Features:
Perform various real data set GWB detection analyses the fastest way possible given the limitations of JAX, Numpy, and your own hardware!
